# AegisFlight — Recovery Audit

**Date of audit:** 2026-09-21
**Auditor:** Continuation session (Claude Opus 4.8)
**Trigger:** Previous autonomous build session interrupted by a laptop crash.

---

## 1. Forensic summary

The repository was recovered in a **pre-commit greenfield state**: `git` had
been initialised on branch `main` but held **no commits**. Only three
top-level paths were untracked-and-not-ignored (`configs/`, `pyproject.toml`,
`src/`); every other directory in the tree existed but was **empty** (git does
not track empty directories, which is why they were invisible to `git status`).

All source files carry timestamps between **23:36 and 23:39 on 2026-09-21** — a
~3-minute window. The last two files written were `configs/*.yaml` (23:39) and
`src/aegisflight/simulator/__init__.py` (23:39). That `__init__.py` imports
`FlightSimulator, SimulatorConfig` from a `.flight` module **that was never
created**. 

**Conclusion:** the crash occurred at the very start of the build, immediately
after the foundation layer (config + core types) was written and just as the
simulator implementation was beginning. Nothing is *corrupted* or *broken* —
the project is simply **~5% complete**. This is a *continuation*, not a repair.

## 2. What was recovered (intact & high quality)

| Artifact | Notes |
|---|---|
| `pyproject.toml` | src-layout, deps pinned, ruff/mypy/pytest configured, `aegis` CLI entry-point declared |
| `configs/{simulation,detector,attacks}.yaml` | Fully-specified, documented thresholds; match built-in defaults |
| `src/aegisflight/config.py` | Typed `AegisConfig` with YAML-over-defaults deep-merge; works without YAML present |
| `src/aegisflight/core/enums.py` | `AttackType` (BENIGN + 6), `Severity` ladder, `DetectorName`, `IntegrityStatus`, `FlightPhase` |
| `src/aegisflight/core/types.py` | `FlightState`, `MessageEnvelope`, `TelemetrySnapshot`, `DetectorResult`, `ThreatAssessment` |
| `src/aegisflight/core/geo.py` | haversine, offset_latlon, bearing, angle-wrap (dependency-free) |
| `.venv/` | Python 3.13.11 with **all** runtime + dev deps already installed (numpy 2.5, pandas 3.0, scikit-learn 1.9, pymavlink 2.4.49, fastapi 0.141, uvicorn, websockets, matplotlib, pytest, ruff, mypy) |

The recovered foundation defines a clean, coherent architecture. **It was
preserved verbatim** and used as the authoritative contract for continuation —
no foundation file was rewritten.

## 3. Component state table

| Component | State | Evidence | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Config system | **COMPLETE** | `config.py` loads & merges; verified importing | Keep as-is |
| Core types/enums/geo | **COMPLETE** | Imports OK; drives all downstream contracts | Keep as-is |
| Simulator | **MISSING** | `simulator/__init__.py` imports non-existent `.flight` | Build `flight.py` |
| MAVLink encode/decode | **MISSING** | `mavlink/` empty; pymavlink installed | Build codec + UDP source |
| Sources (ingest) | **MISSING** | `sources/` empty | Build in-proc + UDP ingestor |
| Attack engine | **MISSING** | `attacks/` empty; config schema exists | Build 6 attack scenarios |
| Feature extraction | **MISSING** | `features/` empty | Build network/nav/sensor/command features |
| Detection | **MISSING** | `detectors/` empty | Build protocol/physics/anomaly/integrity |
| Fusion | **MISSING** | `fusion/` empty; weights in config | Build weighted-fusion engine |
| Integrity | **MISSING** | `integrity/` empty | Build SHA-256 firmware manifest verifier |
| Logging | **MISSING** | `logging/` empty | Build SQLite store + hash-chain |
| Metrics | **MISSING** | `metrics/` empty | Build confusion-matrix / latency / throughput |
| Benchmark | **MISSING** | `benchmark/` empty | Build multi-scenario harness |
| CLI | **MISSING** | `cli/` empty; `aegis` entry-point declared | Build Typer/argparse CLI |
| API | **MISSING** | `backend/app/**` empty dirs | Build FastAPI + WebSocket |
| Dashboard | **MISSING** | `frontend/src/**` empty dirs | Build React/Vite dashboard |
| Tests | **MISSING** | `tests/**` empty dirs | Build unit + integration + e2e |
| Documentation | **MISSING** | `docs/` empty (now holds recovery docs) | Build architecture + proposal |
| Trained model | **MISSING** | `models/` empty | Train Isolation Forest from benign runs |

## 4. Recovery decisions

1. **Preserve the foundation.** All 8 foundation files kept unchanged; they are
   the contract. New code conforms to their types, not the reverse.
2. **No hard reset / no overwrite.** The baseline was committed first
   (`cb16dcd`) so the recovered state is permanently retrievable.
3. **Build the vertical slice first** (simulator → MAVLink → IDS → detect →
   fuse → log → API → dashboard) before optional polish, per the mission brief.
4. **Real numbers only.** All benchmark figures in docs are produced by
   `python -m aegisflight.cli benchmark`; none are hand-written.

`RECOVERY_PRIORITY.md` for the ranked continuation plan.
